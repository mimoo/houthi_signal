  3 percent of US trade runs through the Suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it's necessary.
  
  The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. But I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices.
  
  I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.`,

  I understand your concerns — and fully support you raising with POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what — nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.
  
  Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. Two immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first — or Gaza ceasefire falls apart — and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both.
  
  We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no-go vote, I believe we should. This is not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered.`,

Much of the container either going through the Red Sea still or around the Cape of Good Hope — our components going to Europe that turn into manufactured goods for transatlantic trade to the United States.
  
  Whether we pull the plug or not today, European navies do not have the capability to defend against the types of sophisticated antiship, cruise missiles, and drones the Houthis are now using.
  
  So whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.`,
